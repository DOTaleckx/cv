        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>I began my journey as an IT systems professional in 2021 as a technology assistant for a public school district. Since then, I've expanded my skill set to systems design, programming, and administration whilst working at Sparrow Partners, a commercial real estate builder, developer, and management company. For Sparrow, I worked on a wide variety of projects spanning many different disciplines within IT and system administration. My first independent project was on an in-house SCIM system, which included a user interface, backend database, and loose-coupled automation system designed to see an employee's onboarding, offboarding, or transition through from start to finish at near-zero cost to the company. Outside of my professional career, I enjoy working on personal projects in C, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and GDScript.</p>

        <h3>Collaboration and Teamwork</h3>
        <p>I have 3 years of professional experience collaborating with others on projects. While solo projects can be an immersive challenge, I whole-heartedly enjoy working as a team on designing, developing, and implementing IT solutions. I also seek out opportunities to work with other departments to see their ideas come to life. A critical component I feel is often overlooked in the tech industry is compassion towards others, I like to illustrate this by saying "a mechanic wouldn't talk down to you for bringing in your car". In the same vein, end users should feel seen and heard when they have problems that need to be solved. I prioritize efforts to build relationships with colleagues so we can increase the effectiveness of the company's systems holistically.</p>
